Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:

Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.
The default logging driver is set to syslog.


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]


Good luck!

Ans>
*sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common gnupg
*curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
*sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
*sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
*sudo apt update
*sudo apt install docker-ce
*https://ubuntu.pkgs.org/18.04/docker-ce-test-amd64/docker-ce_18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic_amd64.deb.html
*sudo apt install docker-ce=5:18.09.2~3-0~ubuntu-bionic docker-ce-cli=5:18.09.2~3-0~ubuntu-bionic containerd.io
*systemctl status docker
Now we have to create docker group
*sudo groupadd docker
*sudo usermod -aG docker [non-root user]
*yum install docker -y
*systemctl enable docker
*sudo groupadd docker
*sudo usermod -aG docker rakesh
*cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
*systemctl restart docker 
*su - rakesh
*docker images
*id -a
